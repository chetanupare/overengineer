# Introduction

WPGraphQL for Gravity Forms is a powerful extension for [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) that provides a comprehensive suite of features that allows developers to interact with [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) via GraphQL.

This plugin enhances the developer experience by offering a GraphQL schema tailored for Gravity Forms. The schema provides improved type safety, prevents over-fetching, and makes it easier to interact with your forms and entries than (and even provides functionality not available in) Gravity Form's traditional PHP and REST APIs.

## System Requirements

- PHP: 7.4-8.4+
- WordPress: 6.0+
- WPGraphQL: 1.26.0+
- Gravity Forms: 2.7+
- Recommended: [WPGraphQL Upload](https://github.com/dre1080/wp-graphql-upload) (used for file upload and post image submissions)

## Supported Features

- Querying forms and entries.
- Submitting forms.
- Updating entries and draft entries.
- Deleting entries and draft entries.
- Triggering builds with [WPGatsby](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/) and [Jamstack Deployments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jamstack-deployments/).
