# Updating and Versioning

As the project works towards a 1.0 release, breaking changes may be introduced while new features are being added.

Until v1.0, the project follows a modified version of Semantic Versioning:

- `v0.x`: “Major” releases — introduce new features and **may** contain breaking changes (PHP API or GraphQL schema).
- `v0.x.y`: “Minor” releases — introduce new features/enhancements and bug fixes, **no** breaking changes.
- `v0.x.y.z`: “Patch” releases — reserved for addressing issues with the previous release only.
