# Build Triggers (WPGatsby & Jamstack Deployments)

WPGraphQL for Gravity Forms supports triggering builds with:

- [WPGatsby](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/)
- [Jamstack Deployments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jamstack-deployments/)

This is useful for decoupled and headless architectures where form configuration changes or entry changes should trigger downstream rebuilds.

For the current capabilities and configuration, see upstream docs/issues:
