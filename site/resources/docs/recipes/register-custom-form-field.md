## Register query support for a custom Gravity Forms Field

To see these patterns in action, see `src/Extensions` in the upstream repository.

While this plugin offers basic support for custom Gravity Forms fields out of the box, in many cases you will want to extend the GraphQL schema to provide your custom field data.

The methods described here can also be used to extend support for core Gravity Forms fields that are not yet fully supported.

> Note: You will need to add a FormFieldValueInput in order to submit/update your custom field.

For the complete guide and examples, see upstream docs:
