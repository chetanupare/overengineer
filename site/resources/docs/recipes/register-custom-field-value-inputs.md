## Add GraphQL mutation support for a custom Gravity Forms field

When adding mutation support for custom Gravity Forms fields, you need to:

1. Tell GraphQL what input data to accept.
2. Transform that data into a format that Gravity Forms understands.

While each field differs, the upstream guide covers the common steps.

See upstream docs for the full guide:
